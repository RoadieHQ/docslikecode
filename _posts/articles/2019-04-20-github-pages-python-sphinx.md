If you prefer to write in ReStructured Text instead of Markdown for your technical documentation, you're in good company. There are quite a few benefits to using Sphinx, Python, RST, and Sphinx extensions because these tools are custom-built with developer documentation in mind.

Another great offering is GitHub Pages, with automatic publishing when a known branch, such as master or gh-pages is updated.





I've been working on a talk titled, "Make an Instant Web Site with Webhooks" for DevNet Create. In it, I show how to publish and host on GitHub Pages, which is built to use Jekyll by default, using Python Sphinx instead.
