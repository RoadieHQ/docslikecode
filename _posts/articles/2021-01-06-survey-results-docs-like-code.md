I asked three questions in a survey emailed to my mailing list and got more than 30 responses.

Here are the three questions:

Question 1: When you talk to your leaders about docs-as-code, can they describe the benefits as well as the difficulties?

Question 2: How do you onboard people who are new to your docs tools and processes?

Question 3: What tips or discussions (from any source) was most helpful to you when learning docs-as-code techniques?

Docs-as-code processes are still new in the field and it seems many of the responses are split, with no overwhelming patterns in any single area. Here are the charts for the first two questions.

For question three, I wanted to share any nuggets found in the answers here on the Docs Like Code site, since the goal for this site is to learn these techniques together and share our stories. Here are some highlights. No, this is not a section simply to point to the book, rather, it's to show that having additional resources including people you can ask questions is super valuable when learning how to treat docs like code.
